        This div uses a container class to restrict the "useable" area of the page. This is a common technique to make content on screens appear with appropriate padding. This idea is used in popular frameworks accross the web such as bootstrap and materializecss.

            In order to create my user interface I searched the internet for websites that used the Material Design concepts to see if
            I could gain any inspiration for my site.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the first places I looked was the
            <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/"> Material Design Guidelines</a> website. This is the official specification that should be followed when using
            Material Design concepts. It shows examples for all components as well as general rules to follow throughout
            your site.
            <img src="images/material-design-guidelines-example.JPG" alt="Example of Material Design Guidelines">
            <br /> Using this documentation it should be possible to create any element that is needed and have it conform to the
            Material Design specification.
        </p>
        <p>
            When designing a site to be responsive you should start with mobile devices first and then work up to larger devices. This
            makes it easier to have a consistent design that works on both a mobile and desktop device. Frameworks such as
            <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> lead the way with mobile first frameworks and they have become the normal thing to do since then.
        </p>
        <p>
            In practice this means writing your css classes to work with mobile and using media queries to change the display for larger
            devices. The screenshots below show an example of this for the teams section of the home page.
        </p>
        <h6>Mobile CSS</h6>
        <img src="images/teams-mobile.JPG" alt="Teams Mobile CSS">
        <br />
        <h6>Desktop CSS</h6>
        <img src="images/teams-media-queries.JPG" alt="Teams Media Queries CSS">
        <p>
            The media queries make the team photo section appear next to the individual employee bios.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the influential pages I visited are shown below:
            <br />
            <img src="images/menu-bar-example.JPG" alt="Material Design Menu Bar">
            <br /> This is a good example of a menu bar and this gave me the inspiration for implementing my menu bar.
            <br /> The collapsible side menu was an idea I took from the
            <a href="http://materialdesignblog.com/material-design-showcase/">Material Design Blog</a> and
            <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/4097849--First-Dribbble-Shot">Dribble</a>. I thought it was a good way of providing a menu that worked well on a mobile device.
