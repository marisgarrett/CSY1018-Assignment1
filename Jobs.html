                The jobs above are all for "Web Developers" but as you can see from the requirements the roles can vary hugely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most web developer roles today are split into back end and front end requirements. Back end requirements are the technology
                that runs on the server to create the responses to requests that people make from their browsers. The front
                end is the client side things, like HTML, CSS and JavaScript that run on the browser making the requests.
                The common thread running across all of the job roles is that you must have a good knowledge of HTML, CSS
                and JavaScript (the front end code). Some roles are even only for front end work requiring no knowledge of
                back end code to operate, such as the Front End Web Developer role above. The back end code is very varied
                and there are many technologies that can be used. The roles above show two of these, .NET and PHP.
            </p>
            <p>
                Salary ranges are also quite varied in the industry and there are a lot of factors that determine how much you would get
                paid, these include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Location - The location your job is based in can greatly determine the salary you're offered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Experience - The number of years and type of experience you have is probably the most important factor. A developer with
                    lots of experience in relevant areas can hold out for a better offer should they choose to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Organisation - The organisations ethos is also quite important. If they understand the value that technology can bring into
                    the business then they are more likely to be willing to pay a better salary. There are still a large
                    number of organisations who aren't prepared to invest enough money into their technology because they
                    don't recognise that moving forward an organisations ability to react quickly to changes in the digital
                    marketplace is likely to be a large factor.
